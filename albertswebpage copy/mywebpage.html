<h1><i>My Name is Alberto Tapia and this is my first web page.</i></h1>
<p>This is my first semester at <b>Berkeley</b>. I'm a transfer student from <b>San Diego Mesa College</b>. I'm majoring in Conservation and Resource Studies <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu">CNR Berkeley</a>.The transition from SoCal to Berkeley has been an interesting one. Not having a car here and getting use to the chilly weather is a concern. Regardless of the things I have to get use to I'm excited to see what new adventures await me at CAL.</p>
	<h2>This is a small part of my familia, (from left to right) my older brother Marcos (I call him "Sharkos"), my mom (I call her "MA!"), my grandpa (call him "El Jefe"), and my dad (call him "Dad").</h2>
